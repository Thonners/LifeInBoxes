# LifeInBoxes
D3 based SVG web app to encourage user appreciation of time and life.

The idea is to show a grid of little boxes, 80x52, with each box representing 1 week in your life. Weeks that have passed are shaded in, and as each week passes, the user is to be encouraged to 'shade the box in', and whilst doing so, to take a moment to reflect on the week that has passed.

It's hard to be confronted with one's mortality, but in doing so, hopefully the motivation to make each box count will be that little bit more.

## Long term vision
The long term potential for this is to be a sort of brief weekly diary containing the user's short weekly summaries, notable weeks and photo of the week.
